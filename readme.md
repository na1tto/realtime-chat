# realtime chat using websockets, Go and React

## Websockets

WebSockets offers us duplex communication from a non-trusted source to a server that we own across a TCP socket connection, meaning that we can keep a single TCP socket connection and then send and listen to messages on that, it is this logic that i'm gonna try to aplly in this mini project to create a simple real-time chat service based on the Go programming language and the React JS framework, using a tutorial I found on the internet

## Why?
